        <h1 class="sec1">About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm from Sorsogon Province, but now I am currently went in Apalit Pampanga while pursuing my study in Laverdad Christian School. I am 19 years old and a 2nd year College Student. My parents always advised me and also my two sisters that if we commit a mistake, We should admit it. I try my best to do so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. </p>
        <p>Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy.  I am really not good at sports, honestly I hate sport, but sometimes  in our PE time I am enjoying playing a Badminton. Along with this, I fond of reading a few children magazines in which different motivational stories are there. They taught me a high moral lesson. I am a not really a kind of a confident person and but I always try my best to be a good in terms of communication. I always try to speak in front of the public, I admit that one of my weaknesess is to speak in front of them.</p>
        <p>I don't get mad easily, I talk all the time especially with all my close friends but when I meet new people for the very first time I don't talk as much is shyness. I'm always observing in my sorroundings and looking for anything that can be dangerous or harmful. I'm always the one who opens the door for everyone and I do a lot of other little things like that. I really love to laugh even in the serious situation.</p>
        <p>These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to serve my fellow-people in whatever capacity I can.</p>

    <br><br><br>This quote suits me perfectly because I would describe myself as a cheerful person. I try to stay positive no matter what situation, I am in.
